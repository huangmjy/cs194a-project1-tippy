# Tip Calculator 

## *Michelle Huang*

**Tippy** computes the tip and total amount for a bill. The app uses the base amount and tip percentage to calculate the amount owed, and it also describes the quality of service based on the tip.

Time spent: **3.5** hours spent in total

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can enter in a bill amount (total amount to tip on)
* [X] User can enter a tip percentage (what % the user wants to tip).
* [X] The tip and total amount are updated immediately when any of the inputs changes.
* [X] The user sees a label or color update based on the tip amount. 

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* [X] Custom colors palette selected
* [X] Bill splitting 
* [X] Replace text describing tip with emojis  

## Video Walkthrough

## Notes

I found it weird that you can't set a minimum value for number fields (i.e. 1 instead of 0). Also certain emoji codes don't render -- not sure if it's because they are more recent emoji.
